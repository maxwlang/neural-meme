# Warning!
Some of the metadata in these files is pretty raunchy. It's important to note the following:

1. The metadata in these files is not representative of the views of the author or the publisher.
2. Because of the overly polite nature of common public LLMs, it can be benneficial to be a little over the top in examples fed to the model.
3. A lot of these are user generated submissions from Discord users, and may not be appropriate for all audiences.
